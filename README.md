# Smart-Air-Quality-Monitoring:
team 8 project 
A comprehensive indoor air-quality monitoring device that measures multiple pollutants and environmental parameters. The system detects particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon dioxide (CO₂), volatile organic compounds (VOC), ozone levels, temperature, and humidity. All values are displayed on a color TFT screen in real time, allowing users to assess air quality instantly.
Sensor: PMS5003 (PM2.5), MQ-135 (CO₂ and VOC), MQ-131 (ozone), DHT22 (temperature & humidity)
Controller: Arduino Mega 2560. 
Actuators: 2.8" TFT display (visual output), optional fan for air circulation.

Among all the proposed project ideas, our team selected the Air Quality Monitoring System as the most meaningful and well-balanced option. The project provides a more comprehensive design that combines environmental sensing, data processing, and real-time visualization. It also aligns well with current global concerns about indoor air quality and pollution monitoring.
The project involves multiple sensors — PMS5003, MQ-135, MQ-131, and DHT22 — giving us experience with different types of analog and digital interfaces. Using the Arduino Mega 2560 provides enough I/O pins and memory to handle several sensors simultaneously, while the TFT display and LED array make the data easy to interpret. The optional fan adds a practical way to maintain airflow across the sensors for more accurate readings.
We chose this project because it’s technically challenging but achievable within the practicum timeline. It integrates hardware and software design, sensor calibration, and PCB layout — all valuable skills for future engineering work. The system will be visually appealing in demonstration and provide real, measurable data, making it both educational and rewarding to build.
